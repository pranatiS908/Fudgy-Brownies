Method:

In a bowl, take melted chocolate 3/4th Cup
Add butter at Room Temperature half cup
Since chocolate is warm, butter will melt easily.
Mix it nicely.
Pre-heat oven at 180 degree for 10 minutes pre-heating.
We wil bake brownie for 18-20 minutes.
Add mixture of 1.1/2 Cup Maida & 1 tsp Baking Powder
Mix it.
Add 1 cup Castor Sugar.
Mix it well.
Add 1 tsp Vanilla Essence.
Mix it well.
I love mixing coffee flavour with chocolate.
Coffee enhances the chocolate flavour.
So will add 1 tsp of coffee powder
The mixture is still stiff.
Add 1/2 cup of milk
Mix it well.
Take Walnuts & Chop them. 
Don't finely chop. Leave chunks.
Mix walnuts into the batter.
Have kept the Baking Tin ready, by greasing with oil & lined with butter paper.
Butter paper helps in de-moulding brownie post baking.
Pour the mixture in baking tray.
Spread it evenly.
Put the tray in oven for 20 minutes at 180 degree temperature.
Take out the tray from the oven.
Let it come to room temperature.
Now de-mould it. It will come out very easily.
Eggless Walnut Brownie is ready.
Serve it little warm and with ice-cream or have brownie with black coffee.
